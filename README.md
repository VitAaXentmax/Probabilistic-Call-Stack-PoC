## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the Probabilistic Call Stack Proof of Concept! This tool helps you understand how different execution paths affect call stack signatures. It is useful for enhancing security measures like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response). Follow these simple steps to download and run the application.

## 📝 Features
- **Randomized Execution Paths**: The software generates various paths for executing code, allowing you to explore how they change the call stack.
- **EDR Testing**: Useful for simulating environments to test detection software and improve security protocols.
- **Behavior-Based Detection Research**: Analyze different execution behaviors and how they can be detected.

## 💻 System Requirements
To run the Probabilistic Call Stack PoC, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, or any Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB.
- **CPU**: Any modern multi-core processor.
- **Disk Space**: At least 100 MB available.
- **Additional Software**: Ensure you have a current version of any necessary runtime environment (e.g., .NET for Windows users).
